Blog web application to practice and explore web-app development in the Django Framework. 
The databse is managed using SQLite and the front-end is written using bootstrap and css classes. The information is collected using crispy forms.
I am planning to deploy to heroku soon but for now the application can be viewd locally by following these steps:

1) Clone the Repository
2) cd to the djproj directory 
3) run python3 manage.py runserver

The following operations can be performed right now:
1) create and update user profile. Upload a profile picture.
2) Making/editing/deleting a post ont he blog home page. 
3) Viewing other user's profiles and posts.
