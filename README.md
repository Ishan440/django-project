# djproj
The purpose of the project is to take a dip in the process of creating web apps and to 
learn how different parts of front end and back end interact with each other. The current
state of the project is mainly rough implementations of the basics of all those different parts
using the django framework, following the videos of Corey Schafer on Youtube. Up until now, the 
new things I've got to explore are sqlite and bootstrap. When I finish the basics, I plan to 
practice these more and make the website a little more sophisticated.
